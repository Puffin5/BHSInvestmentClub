                       <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p class="blogtext">     
            Many beginner investors think that investing is simply about analyzing data and predicting the market; however, investing also highly depends on your state of mind. Your attitude towards investing can completely change how you interpret information. Successful investors can understand and manipulate their emotions, goals, and ways of thinking to get their desired outcome. The first step to this success is recognizing what the most common pitfalls are so that you can catch yourself when making your own investments.
        </p>
                    
                    <h2>Physiological Pitfalls</h2>
                    <p class="blogtext">
                        One of the most common pitfalls that investors experience is the fear of missing out (FOMO). This can lead to impulsive decisions that don’t consider the facts. Many may think that an investment is a good choice because everyone is investing in it, but remember that the majority of investors in the market do not make money. You have to base your decision on facts and your own judgment to assure the best result. From time to time you may feel that you missed out on an opportunity, but that it is ok. What matters is that you have full control and confidence in your decision before you make it.
                        <br/><br/>
‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ Sometimes, you may have full control and confidence but still end up losing money. If an investment starts to fail, you must remain rational. Many investors are scared of loss and want to make every investment a win. This is not possible; every investor has some losses, but successful investors have more wins than losses. Learning to accept loss can lead to less losses. When a stock falls, many hold onto it, without analysis, hoping it will go up. Sometimes this will not happen, so continuing to analyze the stock and decide whether to keep it or not is the best course of action. Taking a loss is ok; just try to have more wins than losses.
                        <br/><br/>
‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ When making an investment decision, investors might start analyzing a company with a predetermined bias. The information that you look at should determine your stance on an investment. You should have a stance then defend it with information you find. Investors may block out certain red flags because they have already decided their stance or have a fear of missing out. A successful investor will seek out diverse information and tweak their existing investment strategy to match new details.
                        <br/><br/>
‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ One common theme emerges between all these situations: Emotions cloud your judgment and can lead to bad investments. Whether it's fear or greed, emotions can override your judgment and make you stray from your investment strategy. Investors have to stay disciplined and make informed decisions to become successful.
                    </p>
                        <h2>Philosophies</h2>
                    <p class="blogtext">
                        Certain investment mindsets can guide you to success. One well-known philosophy comes from the book <i>The Intelligent Investor</i> where Graham likens the stock market to a man who randomly tells you prices. The man is sometimes moody and gives you bad prices while other times he's happy and gives you good prices. The key is to only listen to the man when he is giving good prices. This means that you should invest in the stock market when it is to your benefit. You do not always have to keep investing. When markets are risky and volatile, it is ok to sit out. Remember: the stock market is your tool to make your money work for you.                        <br/><br/>
                        <br/><br/>
‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ Another key philosophy to remember is the difference between an investment mindset and a speculative mindset. A speculative mindset takes on more risks by assuming certain details. This type of investor will not conduct in-depth analysis and focus more on short-term trends. While this mindset is not necessarily bad, it can lead to more risk leading to the possibility of loss. On the other hand, an investment mindset aims to shield against risk and make more calculated investments to reliably grow your money. Unlike the speculative mindset, it is focused on long-term trends and value investing. Understanding the type of investor you are can allow you to capitalize on your disadvantages.
                        <br/><br/>
‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ After reading and understanding investing and its nuances it's easy to forget that stocks are just companies. Many times investors look past their feelings towards a company and forget what they are investing in. When you invest, you are giving money to a company to fuel its growth. Investing is a means, not just to grow your own wealth, but also to grow the wealth of the companies that you invest in 
                        <br/><br/>
‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ The way you think about investing can alter the investments you make. Long term investors have more opportunities to capitalize on allowing them to be patient while traders will have completely different mindsets more focused on risky short-term gains. Mindfulness and thoughtfulness can allow you to make better decisions. However, you must also understand your own goals and situation.

                        Thanks for reading and happy investing!

                        Another significant metric is gross profit margin. Gross profit margin shows the amount of money a company keeps from the money it makes. So if a company's gross profit margin was 20% and it made 100$ then the company would retain 20$. This shows a company's profitability or ability to make money. Companies with a higher margin have more flexibility, control, and efficiency, while companies with lower margins tend to struggle to grow. Margin can be calculated by subtracting COGS from revenue then dividing by revenue. Again, comparing this metric against other similar companies can show which company has an advantage over the other.
                    </p>  
                    
                       <h2>Ratios:</h2>
                    <p class="blogtext">
                       The most important ratios on the income statement are the P/E and the EPS. I won’t be explaining these ratios because they are very commonly discussed; however, I highly recommend researching the P/E and EPS ratios if you are not already familiar.
                       <br/><br/>
                       ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ The income statement showcases a variety of ratios including the quick ratio. The quick ratio shows a company’s liquidity or ability to convert its assets into cash and pay off its short term liabilities. Highly liquid companies have the ability to adapt to adverse economic conditions, while non-liquid companies will struggle greatly; therefore, liquid companies tend to be safer. If a company has a quick ratio of 1.50, then for every 1$ of liabilities the company has, 1.50$ of assets that can be converted into cash. So if a company’s quick ratio is 1, then it can pay back all of its liabilities with all of its assets. You want a company that can handle any debt or liabilities it incurs, so a quick ratio of 1 or greater is preferred.
                       <br/><br/>
                       ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ Another prominent ratio is return on equity (ROE). ROE, similar to margin, shows a company's profitability but in relation to equity. Equity is the true value of something. Therefore, ROE measures profitability compared to a company's true value. This helps determine if a company is efficiently using its money to grow. A good rule of thumb for an investor is 15% to 20% ROE, meaning that the company is efficiently using its money and is set to grow at a moderate rate. ROE can be calculated by dividing the company’s net income by its shareholders’ equity. 
                    </p>
                       <h2>Red Flags:</h2>
                    <p class="blogtext">
                       Income statements may also reveal red flags in the company's financials which can indicate that a company may not be a good choice to invest in. One of these red flags is a declining gross margin. A declining gross margin means that a company’s cost of goods sold (COGS) is increasing faster than its revenue. This is a blaring red flag because it shows that profitability is declining rather than increasing. This means that the company is getting less efficient and does not have control over its production.
                       <br/><br/>
                       ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ Another red flag is rising operating expenses. This means that the costs of running a company is increasing. While some increase in operating expenses is normal with business growth, a significant and sustained rise may mean the company is losing efficiency, or being mismanaged. Cost control is very important for a company because too much cost can lead to lower margins, therefore lowering net income and reducing profitability.
                       <br/><br/>
                       ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ The final red flag is high levels of debt and interest expenses. One way to assess if a company's debt is too high is to compare it to its assets which can be found on the balance sheet. High levels of debt and interest expenses means that a company is relying heavily on borrowed funds. Using borrowed funds adds risk and instability. This could mean that the company is struggling or will struggle if there is an economic downturn. More debt means more risk to investors.
                    </p>
                       <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
                    <p class="blogtext">
                       The income statement contains a variety of information that can tell you about a company’s growth, profitability, and efficiency. While many ratios or trends are not directly stated in an income statement, the data allows you to calculate more useful metrics. Remember: an investor's key goal should be to predict a company’s growth. Income statements aid in showing a company’s financial health allowing investors to make better investments to grow their money.
